## Who This Is For

- **Marketing professionals** exploring AI integration
- **Business leaders** planning AI strategy  
- **Technical professionals** building AI systems
- **Career transitioners** moving into AI/tech roles

## Start with the Foundation

### **[The Three Horizons Philosophy](/three-horizons/)**
*Essential reading - my core framework for understanding AI integration*

This is the intellectual foundation for everything I write about. It explains how AI transforms work across three interconnected levels:

- **Horizon 1: Personal AI** - Individual cognitive augmentation ([Framework â†’](/three-horizons/personal-ai/))
- **Horizon 2: Team-AI Collaboration** - Management evolution and collective intelligence ([Framework â†’](/three-horizons/team-ai/))
- **Horizon 3: Process Intelligence** - Organizational transformation ([Framework â†’](/three-horizons/organizational-ai/))

**Time investment:** 15 minutes  
**Why it matters:** Provides the lens for understanding all other content
