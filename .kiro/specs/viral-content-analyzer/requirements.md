# Viral Content Analyzer - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Viral Content Analyzer is an AI-powered system that analyzes high-performing social media content to extract patterns, best practices, and engagement drivers. It then applies these insights to generate optimized content for LinkedIn posts and Twitter threads. This system addresses the challenge of creating consistently engaging content by learning from proven successful examples and applying those patterns systematically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Collection and Storage

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to collect and store viral social media posts so that I can build a comprehensive database of high-performing content for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a LinkedIn post URL THEN the system SHALL extract the post text, author information, and engagement metrics
2. WHEN I provide a Twitter thread URL THEN the system SHALL extract all tweets in the thread with their individual engagement data
3. WHEN content is collected THEN the system SHALL store it in a structured database with metadata (platform, date, author, engagement metrics)
4. IF a post already exists in the database THEN the system SHALL update the engagement metrics without creating duplicates
5. WHEN I upload a batch of URLs THEN the system SHALL process them asynchronously and provide progress updates

### Requirement 2: Pattern Analysis and Insight Extraction

**User Story:** As a content strategist, I want the system to automatically analyze collected content and identify engagement patterns so that I can understand what makes content successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content analysis is triggered THEN the system SHALL identify structural patterns (hooks, formats, length, CTAs)
2. WHEN analyzing engagement data THEN the system SHALL correlate content features with performance metrics
3. WHEN pattern analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate insights about emotional triggers, topics, and timing
4. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL automatically update pattern analysis and insights
5. WHEN I request insights THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations with confidence scores

### Requirement 3: Best Practice Framework Generation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to generate proven content templates and frameworks so that I can apply successful patterns to my own content creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL generate content templates for different post types (story, list, framework, question)
2. WHEN templates are created THEN the system SHALL include specific guidance on hooks, structure, and CTAs
3. WHEN I request a template THEN the system SHALL provide examples from the training data that match the pattern
4. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL version control changes and track performance improvements
5. WHEN I specify my niche (AI/tech/career) THEN the system SHALL customize templates for my specific audience

### Requirement 4: Content Generation and Optimization

**User Story:** As a busy professional, I want to input a content idea and receive optimized LinkedIn posts and Twitter threads so that I can maintain consistent, high-quality content output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a content topic or idea THEN the system SHALL generate multiple LinkedIn post variations using proven patterns
2. WHEN I request a Twitter thread THEN the system SHALL create a structured thread with optimal tweet length and engagement hooks
3. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL explain which patterns and insights were applied
4. WHEN I provide feedback on generated content THEN the system SHALL learn and improve future recommendations
5. WHEN content is published THEN the system SHALL track performance and correlate with predicted engagement

### Requirement 5: Performance Tracking and Learning

**User Story:** As a data-driven content creator, I want to track the performance of my generated content and continuously improve the system so that my content engagement increases over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I publish generated content THEN the system SHALL track its actual performance metrics
2. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL compare actual vs predicted engagement
3. WHEN patterns underperform THEN the system SHALL adjust recommendations and template weights
4. WHEN I achieve high engagement THEN the system SHALL analyze what worked and incorporate those insights
5. WHEN monthly reviews occur THEN the system SHALL provide performance reports and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 6: Integration and Workflow Automation

**User Story:** As an efficiency-focused professional, I want the system to integrate with my existing tools and automate content workflows so that content creation becomes seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect social media accounts THEN the system SHALL automatically collect my published content performance
2. WHEN integrated with scheduling tools THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal posting times based on analysis
3. WHEN using n8n workflows THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints for automation integration
4. WHEN content ideas are captured THEN the system SHALL automatically queue them for generation and review
5. WHEN daily content creation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a streamlined workflow from idea to published post

## Technical Constraints

- System must handle rate limiting for social media APIs
- Content analysis must complete within 30 seconds for real-time use
- Database must support full-text search across collected content
- Generated content must maintain authenticity while applying proven patterns
- System must be scalable to handle thousands of analyzed posts

## Success Metrics

- **Collection Efficiency:** Process 100+ posts per hour with 95% accuracy
- **Pattern Accuracy:** Identify engagement drivers with 80%+ correlation to performance
- **Generation Quality:** Generated content achieves 25%+ higher engagement than baseline
- **User Adoption:** Daily active use for content creation workflow
- **Learning Improvement:** System recommendations improve by 10% monthly based on feedback
