Testing embedding a Substack article to see how it displays and functions on the site.

<div class="substack-post-embed"><p lang="en">Why I'm Studying Data Engineering by Jason Leinart</p><p>ðŸ“Œ From Marketing Data to Data Engineering: Why I'm Taking the Next Step</p><a data-post-link href="https://jasonleinart.substack.com/p/why-im-studying-data-engineering">Read on Substack</a></div><script async src="https://substack.com/embedjs/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is a test post to evaluate using Substack embeds instead of native content. If this works well, we might restructure the site to use Substack for writing with embeds here for discovery and a signup funnel.
