# üì¨ Weekly AI Dispatches #1

*Quick reports from the field. What caught my attention this week.*

---

## üîç This Week's Most Interesting Discovery

**OpenAI's new GPT-4 with structured outputs** changes everything for automation builders. Finally, reliable JSON responses without prompt engineering gymnastics.

**Why it matters:** I spent 30% of my development time handling malformed GPT responses. This could eliminate an entire class of integration problems.

**Testing this week:** Rebuilding my research assistant pipeline to use structured outputs. Early results show 99%+ format compliance vs. ~85% with prompt engineering.

## üõ† Tools I'm Testing

### **CrewAI v0.22**
- **What:** Multi-agent orchestration framework
- **Testing for:** Research workflow automation
- **Early take:** Promising but still feels like over-engineering for most tasks
- **Best feature:** Agent collaboration patterns are well thought out
- **Caveat:** Documentation assumes more AI knowledge than most teams have

### **Anthropic's Computer Use API**
- **What:** AI that can interact with computer interfaces directly
- **Testing for:** Automated data entry and web scraping
- **Early take:** Impressive demos, but latency makes it impractical for real workflows
- **Best feature:** No API dependencies for web interactions
- **Caveat:** Currently too slow for production use (10-15 second response times)

## üìÑ Research Paper Highlight

**"Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback"** (Anthropic, 2022)

**Key insight:** You can train AI systems to critique and improve their own outputs using constitutional principles rather than human feedback alone.

**Practical implication:** This pattern could work for any domain-specific AI system. Instead of training on human feedback for code review, train the system to self-critique using coding principles.

**Worth reading if:** You're building AI systems that need consistent quality control.

---

## üß† Cognitive Observation

**The real AI shift is cognitive, not technical.**

Everyone focuses on model capabilities, but the bigger change is how AI transforms **thinking workflows**:

- **Old:** Think ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Write
- **New:** Think ‚Üí AI Research ‚Üí Co-Analyze ‚Üí Co-Write

The bottleneck moved from information access to information synthesis. This changes what skills matter and how teams should be structured.

**Question I'm exploring:** How do you maintain critical thinking when AI makes everything feel authoritative?

---

## üí≠ Random Thought

Why do we call them "AI agents" when they're more like **cognitive prosthetics**?

Agents implies independent action. Prosthetics implies augmenting existing capabilities. The prosthetic framing better captures how these tools actually work in practice‚Äîextending what humans can do rather than replacing humans entirely.

Words matter. They shape how we think about implementation and adoption.

## üîó Worth Reading This Week

- **["The Coming Wave of AI Automation"](https://example.com)** - Practical timeline for AI adoption across industries
- **["Why RAG is Harder Than It Looks"](https://example.com)** - Real challenges in retrieval-augmented generation
- **["Building AI Systems That Last"](https://example.com)** - Engineering practices for reliable AI applications

## üó£ Discussion Prompt

**If you could only build one AI-powered system for your organization, what would it be and why?**

I'm curious how different people prioritize AI implementation. Drop me a line at jason@jasonleinart.com or connect with me on LinkedIn to continue the conversation.
