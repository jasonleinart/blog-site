Adding a category or tag Permalink
Hydejack allows you to use the list or grid* layout to show all posts of a particular category or tag.

Before you start, make sure your config files contains the features_categories and featured_tags collections:

 _config.yml
collections:
  featured_categories:
    permalink:         /:name/
    output:            true
  featured_tags:
    permalink:         /tag-:name/
    output:            true

Recap: Categories and tags in Jekyll Permalink
Posts in Jekyll can belong to one or more categories, as well as one or more tags. They are defined in a post’s front matter:

---
layout:     post
title:      Welcome to Jekyll
categories: [jekyll, update]
tags:       [jekyll, update]
---

Posts can also be assigned to a category based on their position within the folder structure, e.g.

├── jekyll
│   └── update
│       └── _posts
│           └── 2017-04-07-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown

This will place “Welcome to Jekyll” in the categories jekyll and update.

This is now the preferred way of assigning categories in Hydejack, as it makes URLs correspond more naturally to the underlying folder structure.

Whether you use this method or not, categories will always be part of a posts URL, while tags will not.

Type	URL
Categories	/jekyll/update/2017-04-07-welcome-to-jekyll/
Tags	/2017-04-07-welcome-to-jekyll/
As far as Jekyll is concerned, this is the only difference.

Categories and tags in Hydejack Permalink
Categories and tags are displayed by Hydejack below the title, after the date. Categories are displayed with the preposition “in”, while tags are displayed with the preposition “on”, e.g.

Type	Title
Categories	Welcome to Jekyll¬ 07 Apr 2017 in Jekyll / Update
Tags	Welcome to Jekyll¬ 07 Apr 2017 on Jekyll, Update
Both	Welcome to Jekyll¬ 07 Apr 2017 in Jekyll / Update on Jekyll, Update
You can adjust these in _data/string.yml.

Creating a new category or tag Permalink
By default, categories and tags are rendered as plain text. Further steps are necessary if you want them to link to a page that contains a list of all posts that belong to that category or tag.

For each featured category or tag, a file called <category-name>.md or <tag-name>.md has to be created inside the _featured_tags and _featured_categories folders, respectively. Each file in these folders is part of a Jekyll Collection.

The meta data of a category or tag is set in the files front matter, e.g.

 _featured_categories/hyde.md
---
layout: list
title:  Hyde
slug:   hyde
description: >
  Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme.
  It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
---

layout
Must either list or grid*
title
Used as title of the page, as well as name of the category or tag as part of the line below a blog post’s title. Can be different from the name of the tag or category, as long as slug is identical to the name.
slug
Must be identical to the key used in the blog’s front matter, i.e. if you use categories: [jekyll] the slug must be jekyll. By default, the slug is derived from the title, but here it is recommended that you set it explicitly.
description
A medium-length description, used on the tag or category’s detail page and shown in a message box below the title.
menu
Set to to true if you want the category or tag to appear in the sidebar. For more information, see Adding an entry to the sidebar.
Once the file is created, the page can be found at /category/<categoryname>/ or /tag/<tagname>/.
