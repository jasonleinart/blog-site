# About 

I build systematic frameworks for understanding complex technological transformations before they become obvious. My approach combines pattern recognition with rigorous analytical structure to create strategic thinking tools for early adopters.

## Strategic Framework Development

The Three Horizons Philosophy maps the emerging patterns of AI integration across personal, team, and organizational levels. While few organizations operate at the highest maturity levels today, the systematic progression suggests predictable development trajectories that strategic thinkers can prepare for.

**My approach:** Pattern recognition → systematic framework development → intellectual infrastructure for emerging realities. This methodology prioritizes logical coherence and predictive utility over exhaustive current-state proof, positioning early adopters with strategic advantage when patterns become widespread.

**Current Focus areas:**
- Cloud architecture and data infrastructure
- Marketing automation and AI agent workflows
- Analytics systems and performance optimization
- Strategic frameworks for human-AI collaboration

## Background & Evolution

I bring 9 years of marketing experience optimizing systems and processes for hospitality and home services companies, combined with academic background and deep research skills. Professional psychological profiling identifies me as a "Maverick" - an innovative, outside-the-box thinker undaunted by failure. My INTJ pattern recognition capabilities allow me to see technological transformation trajectories before they become obvious to the broader market.

Currently pursuing AWS Solutions Architect certification and advancing technical capabilities through systematic study of cloud architecture, data analytics, and AI implementation patterns. This transition from marketing practitioner to strategic framework developer reflects the conviction that AI integration represents a fundamental shift requiring new analytical tools.

## Philosophy & Approach

**Predictive Architecture over Reactive Analysis:** I build intellectual infrastructure for emerging realities rather than documenting current states. This approach recognizes that strategic frameworks must map territories that don't fully exist yet but are inevitable based on systematic pattern recognition.

**Human-AI Collaboration Focus:** AI's greatest potential lies in strategic amplification of human judgment, vision, and values—not replacement. The most valuable applications emerge from understanding how human-AI collaboration evolves across personal, team, and organizational levels.

**Early-Adopter Strategic Positioning:** Organizations that develop systematic approaches to AI integration will achieve significant competitive advantages. This site develops the strategic thinking tools needed for effective navigation of this transformation.

## Connect & Collaborate

I'm always interested in connecting with strategic thinkers, technologists, and organizational leaders working on AI integration and systematic frameworks for technological transformation:

## About This Site

This site is built with Jekyll and the Hydejack PRO theme, hosted on GitHub Pages, and continuously evolved as I experiment with AI-assisted content creation and curation workflows.

It's part research notebook, part project documentation, part public learning experiment. The goal is to demonstrate that you can maintain authenticity and depth while leveraging AI tools to enhance (not replace) human thinking and creativity.

**Content types:**
- **[Field Notes](/field-notes/)** - Research paper analysis and insight extraction
- **[Build Logs](/build-logs/)** - Technical project documentation  
- **[Mental Models](/mental-models/)** - Strategic frameworks and big-picture thinking
- **[Now](/now/)** - Current focus and evolution tracking
