# About Jason

Marketing technologist bridging data, automation, and AI to build smarter systems. Strategic thinker focused on practical implementations.

<!--author-->

## My Current Mission

I'm building practical frameworks for AI integration in marketing and business operations—focusing on real implementations that deliver measurable results.

The AI transformation is happening now, but most organizations struggle with the gap between AI potential and practical application. **I bridge that gap**—developing strategic frameworks, proven workflows, and actionable insights for marketing professionals navigating this transformation.

## Background & Evolution

I bring deep experience in digital marketing and operations, where I've spent years optimizing systems and processes for growth-stage companies. Now I'm focused on integrating AI and automation into marketing workflows, driven by the conviction that these tools represent a fundamental shift in competitive advantage.

**What I'm building:**
- AI-powered marketing automation systems
- Data infrastructure for analytics and insights
- Strategic frameworks for human-AI collaboration
- Practical implementations that bridge marketing and technology

**Current focus areas:**
- AWS cloud architecture and data infrastructure
- Marketing automation and AI agent workflows
- Analytics systems and performance optimization
- Strategic consulting on AI integration

## Philosophy & Approach

I believe AI's greatest potential lies in **strategic integration**—not replacing human expertise, but amplifying it through intelligent automation and data-driven insights. The most valuable applications aren't purely technical—they're about understanding business context, customer behavior, and competitive dynamics.

This site is where I develop and share practical frameworks, document real implementations, and explore strategic insights for marketing professionals building with AI.

## Connect & Collaborate

I'm always interested in connecting with marketing professionals, technologists, and business leaders working at the intersection of AI, marketing, and automation:

## About This Site

This site is built with Jekyll and the Hydejack PRO theme, hosted on GitHub Pages, and continuously evolved as I experiment with AI-assisted content creation and curation workflows.

It's part research notebook, part project documentation, part public learning experiment. The goal is to demonstrate that you can maintain authenticity and depth while leveraging AI tools to enhance (not replace) human thinking and creativity.

**Content types:**
- **[Field Notes](/field-notes/)** - Research paper analysis and insight extraction
- **[Build Logs](/build-logs/)** - Technical project documentation  
- **[Mental Models](/mental-models/)** - Strategic frameworks and big-picture thinking
- **[Now](/now/)** - Current focus and evolution tracking

The site itself is an ongoing experiment in building systems that amplify human intelligence rather than replacing it.
