# About

<!--author-->

I'm Jason, an INTJ who spent years in digital marketing before getting fascinated by how AI could amplify human thinking rather than replace it. I'm currently deep in building multi-agent systems, pursuing AWS certification, and documenting everything I learn along the way.

When I'm not coding or writing frameworks, you'll find me volunteering with adult GED students in Detroit, hiking with my dog, or analyzing research papers over coffee. I'm drawn to the intersection of human psychology and machine capability — part sage, part explorer, part maverick — which is why I share my experiments, failures, and insights here.
