# About Jason

Field researcher at the AI frontier. Builder of intelligent systems. Career pivoter learning in public.

<!--author-->

## My Current Mission

I'm documenting the practical reality of building with AI—not the hype, not the theory, but the actual experience of someone figuring it out in real time.

We're living through the most significant technological shift since the internet, but most of the conversation happens at extremes: either in academic papers that are hard to apply, or in marketing content that oversells capabilities. **I'm exploring the middle ground**—the practical reality of actually building with AI.

## Background & Evolution

I come from a background in digital marketing and operations, where I spent years optimizing systems and processes for growth-stage companies. But over the past year, I've been making a deliberate pivot toward AI and automation, driven by a conviction that these tools represent a fundamental shift in how we work and think.

**What I'm exploring:**
- How AI agents differ from traditional automation 
- Building reliable systems with probabilistic components
- Cloud infrastructure patterns for AI/ML workloads  
- The intersection of human intelligence and artificial intelligence

**Current focus areas:**
- AWS certification and cloud architecture
- AI agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, custom architectures)
- Research automation and knowledge management systems
- Cognitive amplification vs. replacement

## Philosophy & Approach

I believe AI's greatest potential lies not in replacing human intelligence, but in **amplifying** it. The most interesting questions aren't technical—they're about cognition, systems thinking, and how we can build tools that make us better thinkers and decision-makers.

This site is my research notebook, project log, and thinking space. I write to clarify my own understanding and to share what I'm learning with others navigating similar territory.

## What I'm Building

**Current projects:**
- AI-powered research assistant using Airtable + Apify
- Google Cloud Functions automation pipelines  
- This site as a testing ground for AI-assisted content workflows

**Coming next:**
- Advanced agent architectures for knowledge work
- Systems for reliable AI-human collaboration
- Frameworks for AI adoption in professional contexts

## Connect & Collaborate

I'm always interested in connecting with others working at the intersection of AI, automation, and human intelligence:

**Email:** dspjson@gmail.com  
**GitHub:** [@jasonleinart](https://github.com/jasonleinart)  
**LinkedIn:** [Connect with me](https://linkedin.com/in/jason-leinart)

If you're building with AI, wrestling with similar questions, or just want to geek out about the future of work, I'd love to hear from you.

## About This Site

This site is built with Jekyll and the Hydejack PRO theme, hosted on GitHub Pages, and continuously evolved as I experiment with AI-assisted content creation and curation workflows.

It's part research notebook, part project documentation, part public learning experiment. The goal is to demonstrate that you can maintain authenticity and depth while leveraging AI tools to enhance (not replace) human thinking and creativity.

**Content types:**
- **[Field Notes](/field-notes/)** - Research paper analysis and insight extraction
- **[Build Logs](/build-logs/)** - Technical project documentation  
- **[Mental Models](/mental-models/)** - Strategic frameworks and big-picture thinking
- **[Dispatches](/dispatches/)** - Quick insights and weekly updates
- **[Now](/now/)** - Current focus and evolution tracking

The site itself is an ongoing experiment in building systems that amplify human intelligence rather than replacing it.
