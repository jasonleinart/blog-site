# ðŸ¤– AI & Automation

Where artificial intelligence meets practical implementation. This is where I document building AI agents, automation workflows, and intelligent systems that solve real problems.

## What You'll Find Here

- **AI Agent Development** - LangGraph, multi-agent systems, and autonomous workflows
- **Automation Pipelines** - From simple scripts to complex orchestration systems  
- **Machine Learning Projects** - Practical ML implementations and model deployments
- **Integration Challenges** - Connecting AI services, APIs, and existing systems
- **Performance & Scaling** - Making AI systems work in production environments

These posts focus on the technical reality of building with AIâ€”the code, the architecture decisions, and the lessons learned from shipping intelligent systems.
