# The Three Horizons of AI Integration: Content Framework

*A unifying framework for exploring the future of work, AI-human collaboration, and intelligent systems*

## üéØ Core Thesis

The future of work isn't about AI replacing humans - it's about evolving how we work WITH AI across three distinct but interconnected horizons: Personal, Team, and Process.

## üèîÔ∏è The Three Horizons Framework

### **Horizon 1: Personal AI (Individual Level)**
**Evolution of Individual Productivity**

**LLM Journey:**
- **Stage 1**: Lazy prompting (ChatGPT Q&A)
- **Stage 2**: Prompt engineering (structured queries)
- **Stage 3**: Context engineering (rich, contextual interactions)
- **Stage 4**: Personal AI OS (integrated workflow systems)

**Key Concepts:**
- **Persona**: Choosing the right model for the right job
- **Communication**: From simple prompts to sophisticated context
- **Integration**: ChatGPT ‚Üí IDE (Cursor) ‚Üí Operating System
- **Tools**: MCP, structured systems, PRDs

**Content Opportunities:**
- Personal AI OS builds and tutorials
- Model selection strategies
- Context engineering techniques
- Workflow optimization case studies
