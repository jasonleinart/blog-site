# ðŸ§  Mental Models

The frameworks I use to think through AI complexity. These posts explore the strategic, philosophical, and conceptual aspects of artificial intelligence and automation.

## Format Characteristics

- **Strategic frameworks** - How to think about AI adoption, implementation, and impact
- **Decision models** - Tools for navigating technical and career choices in AI
- **Systems thinking** - Understanding emergence, feedback loops, and complex interactions
- **Big picture perspective** - Connecting technical details to broader implications

Mental Models posts travel farthest and define my voiceâ€”the "big ideas" that shape how I approach the AI frontier.
