# ðŸ‘¥ Team Horizon (Horizon 2)

Content exploring **The Team-AI Revolution** - how AI transforms management, leadership, and collective intelligence.

## Strategic Focus Areas

- **Management Evolution** - How leadership roles transform in AI-augmented environments
- **Team Transformation** - Strategic approaches to integrating AI collaboration
- **Role Redesign** - Evolution from functional specialists to AI-augmented contributors  
- **Change Leadership** - Navigating identity shifts and organizational transformation
- **Collective Intelligence** - Building teams that leverage both human insight and AI execution

## The Revolution

When AI can handle 70-80% of traditional knowledge work, the fundamental nature of teams, management, and career progression changes forever. This isn't about efficiency gainsâ€”it's about reimagining what teams are capable of when AI becomes a collaborative partner rather than just a tool.

The strategic questions every leader faces: How does management value shift from coordination to orchestration? What new career models emerge when impact matters more than team size? How do you design teams for AI-native collaboration?

## Framework Connection

This content represents **Horizon 2** of the [Three Horizons Philosophy](/three-horizons/) - the crucial bridge between individual AI mastery and organizational transformation. Teams that master AI collaboration become the foundation for organization-wide intelligence.
