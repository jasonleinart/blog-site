Documentation from the trenches. These are complete walkthroughs of building real systemsâ€”with code, architecture decisions, lessons learned, and honest assessments of what worked (and what didn't).

## Format Characteristics

- **Step-by-step documentation** - Complete walkthroughs from idea to implementation
- **Technical depth** - Code examples, architecture decisions, and implementation details
