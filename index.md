# Welcome to the AI Frontier

I'm **Jason Leinart**, and this is my field station at the edge of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another tech blogâ€”it's a live research notebook documenting the practical reality of building with AI.

## What You'll Find Here

### ðŸ§ª [Field Notes](/field-notes/)
Research logs from the cutting edge. I read AI papers so you don't have toâ€”extracting actionable insights from academic research and tracking emerging patterns that matter for practitioners.

### ðŸ”§ [Build Logs](/build-logs/)
Technical documentation from real projects. Complete walkthroughs of AI agent workflows, automation systems, and cloud infrastructureâ€”with code, lessons learned, and honest assessments of what worked (and what didn't).

### ðŸ§  [Mental Models](/mental-models/)
Frameworks for thinking through AI complexity. Essays on strategy, decision-making, and the big picture questions that shape how we approach artificial intelligence.

### ðŸ“¬ [Dispatches](/dispatches/)
Quick reports from the field. Weekly insights, tool discoveries, research highlights, and observations that don't require a full post but are worth sharing.

## Why "Field Notes"?

We're living through the most significant technological shift since the internet. AI isn't just another toolâ€”it's fundamentally changing how we think, work, and solve problems. But most of the conversation happens at either the 30,000-foot academic level or in marketing fluff.

**I'm reporting from the middle ground:** the practical reality of actually building with AI. What works? What doesn't? How do you navigate the hype to find real value? How do you build systems that are both intelligent and reliable?

These are my field notes from that exploration.

## Current Focus

I'm currently deep in building AI-powered research and automation workflows, pursuing AWS certification, and exploring how AI can amplify rather than replace human intelligence. You can see what I'm working on right now on my **[Now page](/now/)**.
