# Welcome to the AI Frontier

I'm **Jason Leinart**, and this is my field station at the edge of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another tech blogâ€”it's a live research notebook documenting the practical reality of building with AI.

## What You'll Find Here

### ðŸ§ª [Field Notes](/field-notes/)
Research logs from the cutting edge. I read AI papers so you don't have toâ€”extracting actionable insights from academic research and tracking emerging patterns that matter for practitioners.

### ðŸ”§ [Build Logs](/build-logs/)
Technical documentation from real projects. Complete walkthroughs of AI agent workflows, automation systems, and cloud infrastructureâ€”with code, lessons learned, and honest assessments of what worked (and what didn't).

### ðŸ§  [Mental Models](/mental-models/)
Frameworks for thinking through AI complexity. Essays on strategy, decision-making, and the big picture questions that shape how we approach artificial intelligence.

## Current Focus

I'm currently deep in building AI-powered research and automation workflows, pursuing AWS certification, and exploring how AI can amplify rather than replace human intelligence. You can see what I'm working on right now on my **[Now page](/now/)**.
