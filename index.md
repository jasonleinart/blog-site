I'm **Jason Leinart**, a marketing technologist bridging data, automation, and AI to build smarter systems. This is where I share practical frameworks, real implementations, and strategic insights from building at the intersection of marketing and artificial intelligence.

## New Here?

Start with my **[comprehensive guide](/start-here/)** that walks you through my core thinking and best content. Or jump straight into the **[Three Horizons Philosophy](/three-horizons/)** â€” my framework for thinking about how AI will transform work across personal, team, and organizational levels.

## How I Write

I organize my writing by format rather than topic, which lets ideas flow naturally across boundaries:

**â›º [Field Notes](/tag-field-notes/)** - Research logs and paper analysis  
**ðŸ”§ [Build Logs](/tag-build-logs/)** - Technical walkthroughs and tutorials  
**ðŸ§  [Mental Models](/tag-mental-models/)** - Strategic frameworks and big-picture thinking

## Current Focus

I'm currently deep in building AI-powered research and automation workflows, studying for the AWS Solutions Architect certification, and exploring how AI can amplify rather than replace human intelligence. You can see what I'm working on right now on my **[Now page](/now/)**.
