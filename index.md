I'm **Jason Leinart**, and this is my field station at the edge of artificial intelligence. This isn't just another tech blog—it's a live research notebook documenting the practical reality of building with AI.

## How I Write

I organize my writing by format rather than topic, which lets ideas flow naturally across boundaries:

**🧪 [Field Notes](/tag-field-notes/)** - Research logs and paper analysis  
**🔧 [Build Logs](/tag-build-logs/)** - Technical walkthroughs and tutorials  
**🧠 [Mental Models](/tag-mental-models/)** - Strategic frameworks and big-picture thinking

## Current Focus

I'm currently deep in building AI-powered research and automation workflows, pursuing AWS certification, and exploring how AI can amplify rather than replace human intelligence. You can see what I'm working on right now on my **[Now page](/now/)**.
