I'm **Jason Leinart**, a marketing technologist bridging data, automation, and AI to build smarter systems. This is where I share practical frameworks, real implementations, and strategic insights from building at the intersection of marketing and artificial intelligence.

## How I Write

I organize my writing by format rather than topic, which lets ideas flow naturally across boundaries:

**ðŸ§ª [Field Notes](/tag-field-notes/)** - Research logs and paper analysis  
**ðŸ”§ [Build Logs](/tag-build-logs/)** - Technical walkthroughs and tutorials  
**ðŸ§  [Mental Models](/tag-mental-models/)** - Strategic frameworks and big-picture thinking

## Current Focus

I'm currently deep in building AI-powered research and automation workflows, pursuing AWS certification, and exploring how AI can amplify rather than replace human intelligence. You can see what I'm working on right now on my **[Now page](/now/)**.
