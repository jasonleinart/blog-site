Kasa - San Francisco, CA
About Kasa

Kasa is the leading tech-enabled hotel and apartment hotel brand and manager. Kasa has built a hospitality operating system that fundamentally improves the profitability of hospitality assets while delivering a high quality, digitally forward experience to guests. We partner with owners of multifamily and boutique hospitality properties to deliver stylish, professionally managed accommodations to business and leisure travelers alike. We took the best that hotels and short-term rentals had to offer and created a new class of hospitality that is well-priced, reliable, and offers a large selection of great locations.

Unlike traditional hotel operators, we prioritize automation, AI-driven pricing, and data-driven decision-making to optimize revenue and improve guest experiences.

This role is fully remote and US-based. We've listed a location because some job boards require one.
