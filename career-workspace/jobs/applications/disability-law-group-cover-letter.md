**Dear Hiring Manager,**

I am writing to apply for the **AI Systems & Technology Integration Manager** role at **Disability Law Group**. With **10+ years** of experience in **AI systems integration and technology leadership**, I have held roles including **Digital Marketing Manager & Systems Integration Lead** at **31st Street Capital** and **Marketing Director** at **Detroit Optimist Society Restaurant Group**, where I focused on **CRM administration, workflow automation, API development, cross-functional team leadership, and strategic technology implementation**. In these positions, I **implemented Go High Level CRM for a $100M+ revenue organization with zero downtime, built custom automated workflows that increased booked appointments by 60%, and reduced operational costs by 40% through Python automation development**.

I'm excited about your firm's mission to help disabled clients and your innovative approach to integrating AI into legal workflows to improve client service. Your search for a "unicorn" who can bridge technology and legal operations resonates with my experience transforming high-volume, detail-intensive business processes through intelligent automation. I am confident that my expertise in **AI integration, CRM optimization, and workflow automation** will make a valuable contribution to your team's success in **transforming legal operations through intelligent technology**.

My experience directly addresses your key needs: I've built automated document processing systems for medical record analysis, created smart intake forms with geographic routing logic, and developed custom workflows that automatically assign cases and send notifications - exactly the type of solutions you need for client intake and case management. Additionally, my background implementing enterprise CRM systems and managing vendor relationships positions me to immediately contribute to your technology stack evaluation and optimization initiatives.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience in **enterprise system implementation and AI-powered process optimization** aligns with your needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

**Sincerely,**  
**Jason Leinart**
