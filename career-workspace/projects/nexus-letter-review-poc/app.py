            I am writing this nexus letter regarding [Veteran Name], DOB: [Date], SSN: [XXX-XX-XXXX].
            
            DIAGNOSIS: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), DSM-5 309.81
            
            MEDICAL HISTORY: The veteran served in Iraq from 2003-2004 and experienced multiple combat situations including IED explosions and direct fire. He reports persistent nightmares, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors since returning from deployment.
            
            MEDICAL OPINION: Based on my examination and review of military records, it is my medical opinion that the veteran's PTSD is more likely than not related to his military service in Iraq. The temporal relationship between combat exposure and symptom onset supports this connection.
            
            RATIONALE: Combat exposure is a well-established risk factor for PTSD development. The veteran's symptoms are consistent with trauma exposure during military service.
            
            Sincerely,
            Dr. [Name], MD
