# Sprint Guide for Career Transition

## What is a Sprint?

A sprint is a time-boxed period (usually 1-2 weeks) where you focus on completing a specific set of goals. It's borrowed from software development but works great for career transitions.

## Sprint Structure

### 1. Sprint Planning (30-60 minutes)
- Review previous sprint results
- Set clear, achievable goals for the next sprint
- Break goals into specific tasks with time estimates
- Prioritize tasks (High/Medium/Low)

### 2. Daily Check-ins (5-10 minutes)
- What did I accomplish yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- What blockers do I have?
- Am I on track for sprint goals?

### 3. Sprint Review (30 minutes)
- What got completed?
- What didn't get done and why?
- What did I learn?
- What should I adjust for next sprint?

## Sprint Best Practices

### Goal Setting
- **SMART Goals:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Focus:** 3-4 major objectives max per sprint
- **Balance:** Mix of job search, skill building, and project work

### Time Management
- **Time Boxing:** Assign specific hours to each task
- **Buffer Time:** Add 20% extra time for unexpected issues
- **Daily Blocks:** Schedule specific times for different types of work

### Tracking Progress
- **Visual Progress:** Use checkboxes and completion percentages
- **Metrics:** Track hours spent, applications sent, skills learned
- **Blockers:** Document what's slowing you down and how to resolve it

## Your Sprint Rhythm

### Week 1: Foundation & Planning
- Monday: Sprint planning and goal setting
- Tuesday-Thursday: Execute high-priority tasks
- Friday: Mid-sprint review and adjustments

### Week 2: Execution & Review
- Monday-Wednesday: Complete remaining tasks
- Thursday: Sprint wrap-up and documentation
- Friday: Sprint review and next sprint planning

## Common Sprint Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-committing:** Better to under-promise and over-deliver
2. **No daily check-ins:** Easy to drift without regular course correction
3. **Ignoring blockers:** Address obstacles quickly before they derail progress
4. **All work, no reflection:** Learning comes from reviewing what worked and what didn't

## Success Metrics

- **Completion Rate:** Aim for 80%+ of high-priority tasks
- **Learning Velocity:** New skills or insights gained each sprint
- **Application Progress:** Measurable advancement toward job goals
- **Energy Level:** Sustainable pace that maintains motivation

Your current sprint setup looks solid - you've got clear priorities, time estimates, and tracking mechanisms. The key is consistency with daily check-ins and honest sprint reviews.
