# Personal Productivity Dashboard
*Horizon 1: Personal AI - Individual Productivity*

## Project Overview
AI-powered productivity system that tracks tasks, analyzes work patterns, suggests optimal scheduling, and provides intelligent insights for personal performance optimization.

## Business Problem
- Difficulty prioritizing tasks across multiple projects
- No visibility into actual time allocation vs planned work
- Reactive rather than proactive task management
- Unclear understanding of personal productivity patterns
- Constant context switching reducing deep work time

## Technical Solution

### Core Features
