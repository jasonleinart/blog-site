# Customer Support Agent Hierarchy
*Horizon 2: Agent Teams - Collaborative Intelligence*

## Project Overview
Tiered AI agent system that handles customer support with specialized agents for triage, FAQ resolution, technical support, and escalation management, creating a comprehensive support ecosystem.

## Business Problem
- Customer support costs $15-25 per ticket with human agents
- 60% of tickets are repetitive questions that could be automated
- Inconsistent response quality and resolution times
- Support agents spending time on routine issues instead of complex problems
- 24/7 support coverage requiring expensive staffing

## Agent Hierarchy Architecture

### **Triage Agent (L1)**
- **Role**: Initial ticket classification and routing
- **Capabilities**: Intent recognition, urgency assessment, routing logic
- **Outputs**: Ticket categorization, priority scoring, agent assignment

### **FAQ Agent (L1)**
- **Role**: Handle common questions and simple requests
- **Capabilities**: Knowledge base search, standard response generation
- **Outputs**: Immediate answers, help articles, basic troubleshooting

### **Technical Specialist Agent (L2)**
- **Role**: Complex technical issues and product-specific problems
- **Capabilities**: Deep product knowledge, diagnostic workflows, solution generation
- **Outputs**: Technical solutions, step-by-step guides, configuration help

### **Escalation Manager Agent (L2)**
- **Role**: Handle escalated issues and coordinate with human agents
- **Capabilities**: Context preservation, human handoff, follow-up management
- **Outputs**: Escalation summaries, human agent briefings, resolution tracking

### **Satisfaction Tracker Agent (L3)**
- **Role**: Monitor resolution quality and customer satisfaction
- **Capabilities**: Sentiment analysis, follow-up surveys, quality scoring
- **Outputs**: Satisfaction reports, improvement recommendations, feedback analysis

## Technical Solution

### Tech Stack
- **Orchestration**: Custom agent routing system with priority queues
- **AI Models**: GPT-4 for complex issues, fine-tuned models for specific domains
- **Knowledge Base**: Vector database with product documentation and solutions
- **Integration**: CRM systems, ticketing platforms, communication channels
- **Analytics**: Real-time dashboards, performance tracking, quality metrics
- **Frontend**: Customer portal and internal agent management interface

### Agent Flow Architecture
```
Customer Query → Triage Agent → Route Decision
                      ↓
FAQ Agent (Simple) → Resolution → Satisfaction Tracker
      ↓
Technical Specialist (Complex) → Solution → Quality Review
      ↓
Escalation Manager (Critical) → Human Handoff → Follow-up
```
