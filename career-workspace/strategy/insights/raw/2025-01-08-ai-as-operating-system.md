# AI as Operating System - 2025-01-08

## Context
Working with Kiro for career strategy, Claude for technical building, and Cursor for project development. Realized I'm not just using AI tools - I'm working within AI platforms that are becoming my primary interface for digital work.

## Core Insight
AI platforms are evolving from tools to operating systems - the laptop becomes the hardware, but AI becomes the interface layer between humans and all digital work.

## Why This Matters
- Most people still think "AI as better search" or "AI as writing assistant"
- I'm experiencing "AI as cognitive infrastructure" 
- This is where enterprise AI is heading - companies will need people who understand AI orchestration, not just AI tools
- This differentiates me from other AI specialists who focus on individual tools

## Potential Applications
- [x] Content creation - "Working in the AI Operating System"
- [ ] Job applications - Position as AI orchestration expert
- [ ] Portfolio positioning - Show sophisticated AI workflow management
- [ ] Framework development - Integrate into Three Horizons philosophy
- [ ] Speaking opportunities - Unique perspective on future of work

## Supporting Evidence
- My actual workflow: Kiro (strategy) → Claude (building) → Cursor (optimization)
- Context persistence across AI platforms
- Natural language interfaces replacing traditional software navigation
- AI proactively suggesting next actions based on goals

## Unique Perspective
- Most AI specialists focus on individual tools or models
- I'm focusing on AI ecosystem orchestration and workflow design
- This aligns with enterprise needs for AI integration strategy
- Demonstrates living the Three Horizons philosophy in practice

## Next Steps
- [ ] Develop this into full strategic framework
- [ ] Create LinkedIn content about AI OS experience
- [ ] Update Three Horizons philosophy to include AI OS concepts
- [ ] Use in job applications as differentiation point
