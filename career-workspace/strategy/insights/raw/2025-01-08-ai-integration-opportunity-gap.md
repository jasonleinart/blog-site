# AI Integration Opportunity Gap - Market Timing Advantage - 2025-01-08

## Context
Realized that while dedicated AI roles require direct experience I lack, many companies don't know how to scope AI into existing roles yet. This creates an opportunity to identify traditional roles with AI integration potential and position as the candidate who can bridge that gap.
