Three Horizons Revised

Upon review I think the big idea is AI as OS is the common thread among all horizons - at all levels moving from persons, teams, and orgs with reactive technology to collaborative technology. Push/pull. Partners.

AI as Operating System is powerful because it captures the interface revolutionâ€”the shift from using discrete AI tools to AI becoming the intelligent layer that orchestrates our entire relationship with digital systems and information.

ðŸŽ¯ Core PhilosophyÂ 
The integration of artificial intelligence into human work represents the next major economic transformation, following the pattern of previous technological revolutions but with a unique focus on amplifying cognitive rather than physical capability. This evolution occurs across three distinct yet interconnected horizons, each representing a different scale of human-AI collaboration and economic value creation.

This evolution fundamentally reimagines how humans and AI work together to create new forms of economic value, optimize resource allocation, and achieve productivity gains that neither could accomplish alone. Like previous technological revolutions, this transformation follows predictable economic patterns while creating entirely new categories of work and value.
