# Consulting Brand Strategy Decision
*Personal Brand vs Separate Consulting Brand*

## üéØ Strategic Question
Should I build consulting offerings under my personal brand (jasonleinart.com) or create a separate consulting brand/company?

## üìä Analysis Framework

### Personal Brand Approach (jasonleinart.com)
**Pros:**
- **Faster to market** - leverage existing site and positioning
- **Authentic personal story** - career transition narrative builds trust
- **Lower overhead** - no additional brand development costs
- **SEO momentum** - existing domain authority and content
- **Flexibility** - easy to pivot between consulting and employment
- **Thought leadership** - personal expertise and frameworks

**Cons:**
- **Scaling limitations** - harder to build team under personal name
- **Client perception** - may seem less "enterprise" than company brand
- **Exit strategy** - difficult to sell personal brand business
- **Professional separation** - consulting and job search mixed messaging

### Separate Consulting Brand
**Pros:**
- **Professional positioning** - appears more established and scalable
- **Team building** - easier to add contractors/employees
- **Client confidence** - company feels more substantial than individual
- **Clear separation** - distinct consulting vs employment positioning
- **Asset building** - potential to sell business in future
- **Specialization focus** - brand built around specific methodology

**Cons:**
- **Time investment** - significant setup and brand development
- **Additional costs** - domain, branding, marketing materials
- **Split attention** - divides focus between job search and brand building
- **Credibility building** - new brand starts with zero reputation
- **Complexity** - managing two brands and positioning strategies

## üéØ Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Personal Brand Foundation (Next 90 Days)
**Strategy:** Build consulting offerings under personal brand while job searching

**Rationale:**
- **Speed to market** - can start consulting immediately
- **Authentic positioning** - "AI Implementation Specialist transitioning to consulting"
- **Lower risk** - if job search succeeds, easy to pause consulting
- **Content leverage** - use same thought leadership for both goals

**Implementation:**
- Add consulting services section to jasonleinart.com
- Position as "AI Workflow Engineering" specialist
- Use personal story and frameworks as credibility builders
- Keep consulting and employment options open

### Phase 2: Brand Evolution (Month 4-6)
**Decision Point:** Based on consulting traction and job market results

**If Consulting Succeeds:**
- Consider separate brand for scaling (e.g., "Workflow Engineering Labs")
- Transition clients to new brand while maintaining personal thought leadership
- Build team and more formal service offerings

**If Employment Succeeds:**
- Keep personal brand for side consulting and thought leadership
- Maintain consulting capabilities for future opportunities
- Use experience to inform full-time role performance
